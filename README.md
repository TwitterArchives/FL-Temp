## RW follower lists temp repo

### Save all lists by clicking the "Code" dropdown and selecting "Download ZIP"

 - Extract handles/IDs: paste into a spreadsheet and use the Data > Split text to columns option.  
 - Can also paste all of them into a spreadsheet and run Data > Data cleanup > Remove duplicates to prevent duplicate blocking submissions.  
  
  
### App: Block Party 
Block Party is good, schedule batches of 5k at a time, you can schedule multiple batches at a time and auto blocks them for you **BUT requires a cc for free trial, costs after the trial.**  Also requires MFA via number or authentication app.

### Extension: RedBlock
Redblock is free browser extension that can block lists or followers of an account but it can only block 500 at a time (inefficient for big accts); I have not tested the other API functions mentioned in link below.
